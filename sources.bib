abstract = {Established in December 1990 and July 1991 respectively, the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges are the only two official stock markets in China. This paper aims to test for randomness in each stock exchange share price index, and to examine the relationship between the two share price indexes. Statistical evidence shows that both the Shanghai and Shenzhen indexes can be best characterized as random walk processes and therefore the markets are efficient individually. However, the Engle-Granger two-stage cointegration analysis and the Johansen procedure suggest a long-run equilibrium relationship between the two stock prices, while the Granger causality test indicates a feedback relationship between the returns of the Shenzhen and Shanghai shares. These results imply that the stock markets are collectively inefficient.},

@article{French1986,
abstract = {Asset prices are much more volatile during exchange trading hours than during non-trading hours. This paper considers three explanations for this phenomenon: (1) volatility is caused by public information which is more likely to arrive during normal business hours; (2) volatility is caused by private information which affects prices when informed investors trade; and (3) volatility is caused by pricing errors that occur during trading. Although a significant fraction of the daily variance is caused by mispricing, the behavior of returns around exchange holidays suggests that private information is the principle factor behind high trading-tune variances.},

@article{Lo1987,
abstract = {Between 1979 and 1987 there were three significant changes in the wage structure in the United States. the pecuniary returns to schooling increased by about a third; the wages of older relative to younger workers with relatively low education increased to some extent; and the wages of women relative to men rose by almost ten percent. It is important for policy purposes to know why these changes occurred and whether they are temporary or permanent. The paper investigates several alternative explanations of these wage structure phenomena, including the most popular ones that their principal causes were shifts in the structure of product demand, skilled-labor saving technological change, and changes in the incidence and level of rents received by lower skilled workers. our reading of the evidence suggests that the major cause of the dramatic movements in the wage structure during the 1980's may have been some combination of changes in both production technology and the average relative nonobserved quality of different labor groups.},

Both hypotheses summarize the conclusion that the forecasting of financial prices through calculating with present and past values are less accurate than predicting that future prices will equal the most recent price. The random walk hypothesis states that daily returns are uncorrelated and the efficient market hypothesis states that investors make no profit from correlation between returns once they've deducted the costs of trading and risk adjustment.},

A Lagrange Multiplier (LM) Fourier unit root test proposed by Enders and Lee (2012) and a stationary test with a Fourier function proposed by Becker et al. (2006) are employed to approximate smooth structural breaks. The results of LM Fourier unit root test show that stock prices in all these seven stock markets demonstrate significant mean reversion. The results of the stationary test can be divided into two parts. When a level term is included in the model, the stock price of Thailand is mean-reverting while stock prices of other regions (Mainland China, HK, China, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore) are non-stationary; when a trend term is included the stock prices in seven stock markets are all mean reversion processes.},

abstract = {We develop a unit‐root test based on a simple variant of Gallant's (1981) flexible Fourier form. The test relies on the fact that a series with several smooth structural breaks can often be approximated using the low frequency components of a Fourier expansion. Hence, it is possible to test for a unit root without having to model the precise form of the break. Our unit‐root test employing Fourier approximation has good size and power for the types of breaks often used in economic analysis. The appropriate use of the test is illustrated using several interest rate spreads.},

Thus, rejection of the null does not necessarily imply rejection of a unit root per se, but may imply rejection of a unit root without break. Similarly, the alternative does not necessarily imply trend stationarity with breaks, but may indicate a unit root with breaks. In this paper, we propose an endogenous two-break Lagrange multiplier unit root test that allows for breaks under both the null and alternative hypotheses. As a result, rejection of the null unambiguously implies trend stationarity.},
